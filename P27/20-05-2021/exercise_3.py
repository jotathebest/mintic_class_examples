# A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors 
# other than 1 and itself. A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number 
# is called a composite number.

# Based on this definition, if we consider the first 10 natural numbers, we can see that 2, 3, 5, 
# and 7 are primes, while 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 are not. In order to have a computer tell you 
# if a number N is prime, you can divide that number by all natural numbers in the range [2, N ). 
# If any of those divisions yields zero as a remainder, then the number is not a prime.

# Write a program to find all the primes numbers from 1 to N, where N is an integer given by the user.
# Write two scripts, one using while and other one using for
